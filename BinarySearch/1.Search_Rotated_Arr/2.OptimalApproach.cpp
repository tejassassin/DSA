// Time Complexity: O(logN) for the best and average case. O(N/2) for the worst case. Here, N = size of the given array.
// Reason: In the best and average scenarios, the binary search algorithm is primarily utilized and hence the time complexity is O(logN). However, in the worst-case scenario, where all array elements are the same but not the target (e.g., given array = {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3}), we continue to reduce the search space by adjusting the low and high pointers until they intersect. This worst-case situation incurs a time complexity of O(N/2).

// Space Complexity: O(1)
// Reason: We have not used any extra data structures, this makes space complexity, even in the worst case as O(1).
